My research lies at the intersection of air pollution, climate change, and human health, integrating exposure assessment, molecular epidemiology, and environmental justice. By combining advanced field monitoring, multi-omics approaches, and community-engaged research, I aim to uncover biological mechanisms of pollution-related diseases and translate scientific findings into actionable solutions that reduce health disparities and support equitable energy transitions.
