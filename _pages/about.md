I am a Postdoctoral Scholar in the Department of Environmental Health Sciences at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health. I received my doctoral degree in Environmental Health from Peking University in 2022. My research focuses on the intersection of air pollution, climate change, and human health, integrating exposure assessment, molecular epidemiology, and environmental justice. Through a combination of advanced field monitoring, multi-omics approaches, and community-engaged research, I investigate the biological mechanisms linking environmental exposures to disease and work to translate scientific evidence into actionable solutions that reduce health disparities and support equitable energy transitions.
