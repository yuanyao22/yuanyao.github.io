excerpt: 'This panel study links short-term nitrogen dioxide and fine particulate matter exposure to neuroendocrine stress hormone changes, advancing mechanistic understanding of air pollution health effects. Findings highlight differential responses in COPD versus non-COPD participants, offering novel evidence of stress-axis dysregulation as a pathway for pollution-related disease.'
